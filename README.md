CICIDS Multi-Class Intrusion Detection System
A machine learning-based web application that detects and classifies network traffic into multiple attack categories using the CICIDS 2017 dataset. The system is built using Random Forest and provides real-time predictions through an interactive Streamlit interface.

Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying malicious network activity by analyzing traffic flow features. It classifies traffic into multiple categories such as:
* BENIGN
* DoS
* DDoS
* PortScan
* BruteForce
* Bot
* Infiltration

The goal is to build a practical intrusion detection system that can assist in identifying cyber threats effectively.

Approach--
The project follows a structured machine learning pipeline:

1. Data Collection

   * CICIDS 2017 dataset (network flow data)

2. Data Preprocessing

   * Merging multiple CSV files
   * Removing duplicates and missing values
   * Grouping similar attack types
   * Handling data imbalance

3. Feature Engineering

   * Selecting top 35 important features using feature importance

4. Model Training

   * Random Forest Classifier
   * Train-test split with stratification
   * Standard scaling for normalization

5. Model Evaluation

   * Accuracy and classification report
   * Performance analysis across attack classes

6. Deployment (Local)

   * Streamlit-based UI for real-time predictions


Dataset
* Dataset Used: CICIDS 2017
* Type:** Network flow-based dataset
* Total Features: ~80+
* Selected Features: Top 35 (based on importance)

The dataset includes both normal traffic and multiple attack scenarios captured in realistic network environments.

Usage

* **Manual Input:** Enter feature values directly in the UI
* **CSV Upload:** Upload a single-row CSV with required features
* The system outputs:

  * Predicted attack type
  * Confidence score
  * Probability distribution across classes


Model Details

* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier
* **Features Used:** Top 35 important features
* **Scaling:** StandardScaler
* **Label Encoding:** LabelEncoder


Limitations

* Imbalanced classes like *Infiltration* have very few samples
* Model performance depends on input quality
* Uses flow-based features, not real-time packet capture


Future Improvements

* Use advanced models like XGBoost or LightGBM
* Apply SMOTE for better handling of rare classes
